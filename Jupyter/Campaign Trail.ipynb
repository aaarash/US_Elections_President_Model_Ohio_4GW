      "Incomes and wages were flat-lining while the cost of everything from college to health care to groceries to gas were all going up. 0.4939\n",

      "But we knew that we had to get started to reclaim this dream.---- 0.4357\n",
      "And then what we discovered was that because of irresponsibility, because of economic policies that had failed and a lack of oversight when it came to regulations, we inherited the worst financial crisis and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. -0.9705\n",

      "And so even though over the last three and a half years, our central focus has been how do we recover from this crisis, and get people back to work, and make sure that small businesses are doing well again, and that they're getting financing -- despite all those things, our goal has not just been to get back to where we were before the crisis struck, but rather to build an economy that lasts --  -- to build an economy that says no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter what your last name is, you can make it if you try here in America. -0.8349\n",

      "So right now their main prescription for growing the economy faster is an additional $5 trillion in tax cuts, most of which would go to the wealthiest Americans, even if to pay for it you’d have to gut education programs, or turn Medicare into a voucher program, or eliminate our investments in basic research and science. 0.3182\n",

      "And everybody says the deficit and the debt are important, and I agree. -0.2263\n",
      "And I just want to point out, the last time we did that, when Bill Clinton was President, we had surpluses, not deficits, created 23 million new jobs, and by the way, we created a lot of millionaires and billionaires to boot. -0.2914\n",

      "First of all, if you hear anybody say that somehow we are impeding the development of our energy resources here in this nation, I want you to know these facts:  oil production -- higher than it’s been in eight years; natural gas production -- higher than it’s been probably in our lifetimes; oil imports -- actually lower than they’ve been in 16 years. 0.4019\n",
      "In fact, our oil imports are less than 50 percent now for the first time in a very long time. 0.0\n",
      "And so we’re moving in the right direction in terms of energy independence. 0.2732\n",
      "Now, part of that is this boom in natural gas.------------------- 0.3612\n",
      "And this is something we should welcome, because not only are we blessed with incredible natural gas resources that are now accessible because of new technologies, but natural gas actually burns cleaner than some other fossil fuels, and is an ideal fuel -- energy source that we potentially can use for the next 100 years. 0.9497\n",
      "So I want to encourage natural gas production.------------------- 0.7688\n",
      "The key is to make sure that we do it safely and in a way that is environmentally sound. 0.6705\n",
      "Now, you always hear these arguments that somehow there’s this huge contradiction between the environment and economic development, or the environment and energy production. 0.0065\n",
      "And the fact of the matter is that there are a lot of folks right now that are engaging in hydraulic fracking who are doing it safely. 0.6908\n",
      "The problem is, is that we haven’t established clear guidelines for how to do it safely, and informed the public so that neighbors know what’s going on, and your family, you can make sure that any industry that’s operating in your area, that they’re being responsible. 0.7717\n",
      "So what we’ve said is, look, we are going to work with industry to establish best practices. 0.6369\n",
      "We are going to invest in the basic research and science required to make sure this is done safely and in a way that protects the public health. 0.7783\n",
      "And for responsible companies, they should be able to operate, make a profit, and we can all benefit and put people back to work. 0.802\n",
      "But if you’re an irresponsible company that’s not doing the right thing, we’re going to hold you to account. -0.5927\n",
      "And that’s how we should develop this incredible resource -- which, by the way, if we do it properly, could end up changing the economics and politics globally of energy in a way that's actually very good for us, because we'll be less dependent on what happens in the Middle East and our economy will be less subject to the kinds of spikes that we saw earlier in the spring in terms of gas prices. 0.6478\n",
      "Thank you for the question.-------------------------------------- 0.3612\n",
      "All right, it's a woman's turn.---------------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "That young lady in the white t-shirt right there -- hold on, hold on, wait for the mic. 0.0\n",
      "Q    My name is Delisha White (ph) and I and my husband, we're small business owners. 0.0\n",
      "And he actually has a question that he needs to answer.---------- 0.0\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  Well, wait.-------------------------------------- 0.2732\n",
      "No, no, you can't do that now.----------------------------------- -0.5267\n",
      "I called on the young lady and that's what's called a bait and switch. 0.0\n",
      "That is what's called a bait and switch.------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "No, the rule is that I'm going to make sure that women get equal time with men. 0.0258\n",
      "Q    Well, we would like --\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, no, no, no, no.-- -0.4939\n",
      "Q    Okay, his question was, he is a small business owner and he wanted to know what can you do for the self-employed -- for self-employed businesses with less than 10 employees working with him. 0.2263\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, here's what I'm going to do.--------------- 0.2263\n",
      "I'm going to let him go ahead and ask his question.-------------- 0.0\n",
      "And then, I'm going to call on two women in a row.--------------- 0.0\n",
      "Because this is -- we got cheated here.-------------------------- -0.5106\n",
      "Go ahead.-------------------------------------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "Next time, you stand up.----------------------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "Don't send your wife out first.---------------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "Q    Okay, I'm Tony White and hello, Mr. President.-------------- 0.2263\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  Good to see you, Tony.--------------------------- 0.4404\n",
      "What kind of business do you have?------------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "Q    A barbershop and beauty salon.------------------------------ 0.5859\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  There you go.------------------------------------ 0.0\n",
      "Q    I've been in business for over 10 years now.---------------- 0.0\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.------------------------------------ 0.6249\n",
      "Q    And what I'm trying to find out is what will you be doing, or if there's anything you'll be doing, for the self-employed and businesses with employees -- with less than 10 employees. 0.0\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  Absolutely.-------------------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "Q    And also, when can I cut your hair?------------------------- -0.2732\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let me answer the second question first. 0.2732\n",
      "You know that you would not want a President who is disloyal to his barber. -0.0572\n",
      "I mean, a man and his barber, that's a strong connection.-------- 0.5106\n",
      "Q    I know, I know.--------------------------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  So I am not going to let you cut my hair because my barber would be hurt. -0.6705\n",
      "Q    Just one time, just once.----------------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  Maybe I’ll let you give me a line -- a little bit. 0.0\n",
      "Q    Yeah, yeah, we can do that.--------------------------------- 0.5267\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  All right, in terms of small business -- look, small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. 0.0\n",
      "They account for most of the new job growth.--------------------- 0.3818\n",
      "We’ve got obviously great big businesses.------------------------ 0.6249\n",
      "In this area, Proctor & Gamble is an example of an outstanding large business. 0.6124\n",
      "But a lot of the job growth happens with small businesses who then become medium-sized businesses and then maybe at some point become large businesses. 0.5267\n",
      "So ever since I came into office, one of my biggest priorities was how do we support small businesses -- which is why we’ve actually provided 18 different tax breaks just targeted at small business since I’ve been in office. 0.4019\n",
      "It’s the reason why we have pushed the Small Business Administration, especially when the recession had just hit, to extend additional financing and to waive fees for small business, because one of the biggest challenges for small businesses is getting credit lines. 0.1372\n",
      "Q    Yes, it is.------------------------------------------------- 0.4019\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  And we’ve actually been pushing the banks to say, look, taxpayers pulled your backside out of the fire --  -- it’s now important for you to step up and make sure that small businesses aren’t finding their credit restricted, especially if they’ve been in business for a while. 0.1779\n",
      "The other thing we’ve done is to say, what are the critical needs of small business? -0.3182\n",
      "A lot of time, one of the biggest challenges is to make sure that you, as a sole proprietor, that you can get health insurance for you and your family. 0.3818\n",
      "So when you hear about the Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare --  -- and I don’t mind the name because I really do care. 0.7703\n",
      "That’s why we passed it.----------------------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "You should know that once we have fully implemented, you’re going to be able to buy insurance through a pool so that you can get the same good rates as a group that if you’re an employee at a big company you can get right now -- which means your premiums will go down. 0.4404\n",
      "We will also give you additional tax credits if you are providing health insurance for your employees -- we’ll give you tax credits for that. 0.6124\n",
      "Right now, one of the things we’re pushing Congress to do is to give you a tax credit if you hire additional workers, or you give folks who are a working for you a raise. 0.3818\n",
      "We want to give you incentive to do that.------------------------ 0.4215\n",
      "But this is an example of where there’s a contrast between myself and my opponent. 0.0\n",
      "As I said before, his basic tax plan is to give folks at the top a tax break. 0.2023\n",
      "Now, we can have that debate, but what I’ve said is, in the meantime, let’s give 98 percent of individuals and 97 percent of small businesses some certainty right now by going ahead and passing a law that says your taxes won’t go up. 0.3612\n",
      "Because if Congress doesn't act, by the way, by January 1st, everybody’s taxes here are going to go up, by an average of about $1,600 -- if Congress doesn't do anything. 0.0\n",
      "And so what I’ve said is if you really want to help small business right now, give 97 percent of them the certainty that their costs will not go up. 0.6764\n",
      "And then we can have a debate about the other 2, 3 percent.------ 0.0\n",
      "Now, one last point I’m going to make on this small business and taxes argument -- you’ll hear Republicans say, you know what, if you tax, let’s say, somebody with a million dollars of income, you're going to be crushing the small business jobs creators. -0.6124\n",
      "Now, first of all, I’ve just explained 97 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000 a year. 0.0\n",
      "But setting aside that, the way they describe small businesses, half of the Fortune 400 richest Americans in the country would qualify as a \"small business.\" 0.6808\n",
      "Hedge fund managers would qualify as small business, even if they were pulling in a billion dollars a year. 0.0\n",
      "And this is an example of what I mean when I say we just want everybody to be treated fairly. 0.0772\n",
      "AUDIENCE:  Right!------------------------------------------------ 0.0\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  Michelle and I were talking the other day, and Michelle’s dad worked as a blue-collar worker. 0.0\n",
      "He was at the water filtration plant in Chicago, worked there all his life -- all his adult life. 0.0\n",
      "And he had MS, so by the time I met him, he could barely walk.--- 0.0\n",
      "But he never missed a day of work.------------------------------- 0.3252\n",
      "He had to use two canes.----------------------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "He had to wake up an hour earlier than everybody else just to get dressed. 0.0\n",
      "But he never missed a day of work.------------------------------- 0.3252\n",
      "And he took pride in being at the job, even if he didn’t feel well. 0.5423\n",
      "And he used to tease folks who were lazy -- he'd say, these people are so lazy they won't even go to work to pick up their paycheck. -0.743\n",
      "They want it mailed to them.------------------------------------- 0.0772\n",
      "And Michelle's mom, she stayed at home when the kids were young and then she went to work as a secretary. 0.0\n",
      "And she worked as a secretary most of her adult life.------------ 0.0\n",
      "So the point is, they didn’t have a lot.------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "But Michelle and I were talking about how they didn’t envy people who had a lot more. -0.3919\n",
      "There was no sense that somehow our lives are less because we're not millionaires, we're not making huge amounts of money. -0.4874\n",
      "God bless folks who are doing successful -- who are successful and doing well. 0.9274\n",
      "The only thing that Michelle's parents, my mom, my grandparents, the only thing they didn’t like is when you felt like folks at the top were taking advantage of their position and not following the same rules as everybody else and keeping other folks down. 0.7783\n",
      "And we don’t want an economy in which some are being treated differently than others. 0.0772\n",
      "That’s all.------------------------------------------------------ 0.0\n",
      "And that’s especially true when it comes for our small business folks. 0.4754\n",
      "I want them to have some of the same advantages, because you probably can't afford the same number of lawyers and accountants and all that stuff that are working all these loopholes. 0.4767\n",

      "THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'll be honest, sometimes people ask me what's my disappointment since I've come into office. 0.2732\n",
      "And obviously, we're always trying to grow the economy faster, put people back to work faster. 0.0\n",
      "But one of the disappointments I've had is that we have not changed the tone in Washington the way I wanted to. -0.6124\n",
      "Now, part of this just has to do with the fact that the other side had a basic economic -- or a basic political theory after I got elected -- and this is not my opinion. 0.0\n",
      "I mean, this has been said by the leader of the Senate minority in Washington. 0.0\n",
      "And the basic theory was, you know what, we kind of screwed things up; Obama is really popular right now; if we cooperate with him, then he'll get credit, so we're better off just saying no. 0.4902\n",
      "And if we do that, then over time folks will forget the mess he inherited and we can go after him, and hopefully that will help our politics. 0.25\n",
      "Again, this is not my theory.------------------------------------ 0.0\n",
      "This is explicitly their strategy.------------------------------- 0.0\n",
      "What's true is also we've got, as I said, two different visions about how to move the country forward. 0.5719\n",
      "But my hope is that this election allows us to, once and for all, resolve some of the bigger questions about how we move the country forward -- because right now we've got as stark a choice as you could imagine. 0.8047\n",

      "The point is that, these days, if you want to be a plumber, if you want to be an electrician, you want to be working in a factory, you are generally going to need a little bit more training than high school provides -- which is why our community college system is so important. 0.505\n",
      "But you are absolutely right that one of the, I believe, mistakes we made 20, 30 years ago was to start deemphasizing vocational education --  -- because not everybody wants to sit in a classroom with a book. -0.5023\n",
